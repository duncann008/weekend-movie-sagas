# Weekend Movie Sagas

## Description

Updated the provided code to use sagas and added features for the user.

### How I went about my work:

1.  Always initialize first:  npm install and split my terminal to npm run server and npm run client.

2.  I like to have my components set up and routed before diving any deeper.

    *   Made folders and files for each component I'd need.
